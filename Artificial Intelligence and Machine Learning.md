## Artificial Intelligence

Use of technologies that can mimic cognitive functions of humans.

Includes being able to see, understand, and respond to spoken or written language, analyze data, make recommendations and more.

AI is an umbrella category that includes machine learning, robotics, expert systems and natural language processing, and generative AI.

## [[Machine Learning]]

Subset of AI that les machines learn from data without explicit programming.

Relies on models to analyze large amounts of data, learn from insights, and make predictions and informed decisions.

## Generative AI

Artificial intelligence that can produce new content including text, images, audio and synthetic data.

## Responsible AI

AI should be
- socially beneficial
- avoid creating or reinforcing unfair bias
- build and tested for safety
- accountable to people
- incorporate privacy design principles
- uphold standards of scientific excellence
- made available for uses that accord with these principles

## Explainable AI
Tools and frameworks to help understand and interpret predictions made by your machine learning models.

## AI Solutions

## Considerations for Selecting AI and ML

### Speed to Production / Market
How quickly do you need something in production?

### Differentiation
How unique is your model? Or how unique does it need to be?

### Expertise Required
What roles are required? Data scientists, data engineers, machine learning engineers among others.

### Effort Required
How complex is the problem? How much data is available? How experienced is the team?
