- Projects
- Resources

#### Policies
- Applied at Organization, Folder and Project levels

#### Projects
- Basis for enabling and using all Google Cloud services
- Can have different owners and users because they are billed and managed separately

	- project ID - globally unique, generated by Google but can be changed by user, immutable after creation
	- project name - user defined, not unique, mutable
	- project number - globally unique, assigned by Google, immutable
- Google Cloud Resource Manager API - manage projects programmatically
	- list, create, update, delete and recover projects
	- accessible vie RPC API and REST API

#### Folders
- Contain projects and other folders or combinations of both
- Assign policies at chosen level of granularity - e.g. folder per department
- Ability to delegate administrative responsibilities to folder level so teams can work independently

#### Organization

- Required to use folders
- Some special roles associated with organization level 
- e.g.:
	- Organization policy administrator - grant privileges to set organization policies
	- Project creator role - who can create projects, therefore spend money
- Creating
	- Google Workspace customers have one automatically, and projects are nested under it
	- Non Workspace customers - [[Cloud Identity]] can be used to create an organization
