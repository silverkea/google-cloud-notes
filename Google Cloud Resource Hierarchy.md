#### Hierarchical Structure
- Organisation
- Folders
- Projects
- Resources

#### Policies
- Applied at Organization, Folder and Project levels
- Some services can apply policies to individual resources
- Inherit downwards

#### Projects
- Basis for enabling and using all Google Cloud services
- Can have different owners and users because they are billed and managed separately
- Identifying attributes 
	- project ID - globally unique, generated by Google but can be changed by user, immutable after creation
	- project name - user defined, not unique, mutable
	- project number - globally unique, assigned by Google, immutable
- Google Cloud Resource Manager API - manage projects programmatically
	- list, create, update, delete and recover projects
	- accessible vie RPC API and REST API

#### Folders
- Contain projects and other folders or combinations of both
- Assign policies at chosen level of granularity - e.g. folder per department
- Ability to delegate administrative responsibilities to folder level so teams can work independently
- Typically used to represent business units, departments, teams or products

#### Organization
- Root node of GCP resource hierarchy, not mandatory unless using certain features
	- Centralized policy management
	- IAM at the organization level
	- Centralized billing and cost management
	- Resource hierarchy management (folders)
	- Access to certain support levels
- Creating - closely associated with a G Suite or Cloud Identity Account
	- Google Workspace customers have one automatically, and projects are nested under it
	- Non Workspace customers - [[Cloud Identity]] can be used to create an organization
- Some special roles associated with organization level
- e.g.:
	- Organization policy administrator - grant privileges to set organization policies
	- Project creator role 
		- who can create projects, therefore spend money
		- can be applied at organization or project level

- Workspace or Cloud Identity super administrator
	- Assigns the Organization admin role to some users
	- Point of contact in case of recovery issues
	- Control the lifecycle of the workspace or Cloud Identity account and Organization resource

- Organization admin:
	- Define IAM policies
	- Determine structure of resource hierarchy
	- Delegate responsibility for components such as Networking, Billing, Resource Hierarchy through IAM roles
	- Following least privilege principle, the role doesn't have permission to perform other actions like create folders unless additional roles are assigned to the account of the organization admin
	
- Often the Workspace or Cloud Identity super administrator and the Organization admin different users or groups

#### Resource Manager Roles
