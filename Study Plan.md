## [[Setting Up a Cloud Solution Environment]]

- Create resource hierarchy
- Apply organizational policies
- Grant members [[Identity and Access Management (IAM)|IAM]] roles withing a project
- Manage users and groups in [[Cloud Identity]]
- Enable APIs within projects
- Provision and set up products in [[Google Cloud Observability]]
- Billing management and quotas and requesting increases

## [[Planning and Configuring Solutions]]

### Considerations
- Compute options
	- VM / Container / Serverless
- Data solutions
	- Throughput and latency will determine performance
	- Data processing transactional or analytical?
	- Is relational querying required?
	- Large groups of data returned in non relational get operation?
- Network connectivity
	- Internet connectivity?
	- Private network connectivity?
	- Network or system outage mitigation strategies

## [[Deploying and Implementing Solutions]]

- Availability, concurrency, connectivity and access options
- Data solutions that utilize relational or NoSQL databases
- Use cases for transactional or analytical data processing
- Deploying infrastructure in a declarative way
- Infrastructure as code to reduce human error
- Interacting via Cloud console, command line or programmatically (API)
