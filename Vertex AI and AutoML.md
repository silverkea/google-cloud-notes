Brings together Google Cloud services for building ML under one unified user interface.

After data is ingested into [[Vertex AI]], Auto ML chooses the best machine learning model for you by comparing different models and tuning parameters.


## [[AutoML]] Vision
Alternative to [[Vision API ]]that can be trained with specialized data. Allows automating the training  of machine learning models so a batch of images can be uploaded to train an image classification model through graphical interface.

## [[AutoML]] Natural Language
Alternative to [[Natural Language API]] that lets you build and deploy custom machine learning models to analyze documents, categorize them, identify entities within them, or assess attitudes within them.

## [[Custom Model Training]]
Vertex AI also provides ability for creating [[Custom Model Training|custom end to end machine learning models]].
