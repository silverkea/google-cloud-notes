Machine Learning is suited for four common business problems:

- Replace / simplify rule based systems
- Automating processes
- Understanding unstructured data
- Personalization

## Data quality

To assess quality of data for training a ML model, it is assessed against six dimensions

- Completeness
- Uniqueness - many unique examples instead of a lot of similar / same examples
- Timeliness
- Validity
- Accuracy
- Consistency

## ML Options on Google Cloud

- [[BigQuery ML]] - use SQL queries to create and execute machine learning models in BigQuery
- [[Pre-trained APIs]] - use ML models built and trained by Google
- [[Vertex AI and Auto ML|AutoML]] - no-code solution to build ML models on [[Vertex AI and Auto ML|Vertex AI]]
- [[Custom Model Training]] - Code your own ML environment to have control over the ML pipeline


## [[TensorFlow]]
End to end open source platform for machine learning.
