Machine Learning is suited for four common business problems:

- Replace / simplify rule based systems
- Automating processes
- Understanding unstructured data
- Personalization

## Deep Learning
Subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers (deep) to learn from large amounts of data. It is well suited for tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing and speech recognition.

- Enable the processing of highly complex patterns and the generation of sophisticated predictions.
- Leverage both labeled and unlabeled data - semi-supervised learning. 
- Small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. 
- Learn foundational concepts and generalize effectively to novel examples.

## Data quality

To assess quality of data for training a ML model, it is assessed against six dimensions

- Completeness
- Uniqueness - many unique examples instead of a lot of similar / same examples
- Timeliness
- Validity
- Accuracy
- Consistency

## ML Options on Google Cloud

- [[BigQuery ML]] - use SQL queries to create and execute machine learning models in BigQuery
- [[Pre-trained APIs]] - use ML models built and trained by Google
- [[Vertex AI and AutoML|AutoML]] - no-code solution to build ML models on [[Vertex AI and AutoML|Vertex AI]]
- [[Custom Model Training]] - Code your own ML environment to have control over the ML pipeline


## [[TensorFlow]]
End to end open source platform for machine learning.
