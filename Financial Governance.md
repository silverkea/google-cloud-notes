Effective cost management requires partnership across finance, technology and business functions.

### People, Process, Technology
#### People - Cloud Center of Excellence
- Ensure best practices in place across organisation
- Ensure visibility into ongoing cloud spend
- Make real-time decisions and discuss trade-offs

#### Process 
- Daily / Weekly - monitor and analyze cloud usage costs
- Weekly / Monthly - finance team analyze results, charge back costs to appropriate teams
- Culture of accountability helps recognize and eliminate waste and maximize investment
- Empower cross-group collaboration across technology, finance and business teams to align cloud spend with business objectives

#### Technology - Tools for Cost Monitoring & Management
- Greater visibility
- Drive culture of accountability
- Control costs and reduce overspending risk
- Intelligent recommendations to optimize cost and usage


### Best Practices
- Identify who manages cloud costs
- Understand invoices versus cost management tools
- Use Google Cloud's cost management tools
	- Capture what cloud resources are used, by whom, for what purpose, at what cost
	- Determine who is responsible for monitoring and managing, and how spending will be reported ongoing
	- Set up cadence and format for communication with stakeholders


### Google Cloud Pricing Calculator
Estimates how changes to cloud usage will affect costs.


### Resource Hierarchy for Access Control

Resource hierarchy contains four levels
	- Organization
	- Folders - can contain other folders or projects
	- Projects
	- Resources

#### Policies
- Set of rules that define who can access a resource and what they can do
- Can be defined at project, folder and organization node levels
- Some services can apply policies to individual resources

#### Benefits
- Granular access control - can assign roles and permissions
- Inheritance and propagation rules - permissions from higher level inherited by lower level
- Security and compliance - applying least privilege principle
- Visibility and auditing capabilities - track changes across different levels of hierarchy

### Controlling Cloud Consumption

Google Cloud offers tools to control consumption

#### Resource Quota Policies
- Set limits on amount of resources that can be used for project or user

#### Budget Threshold Rules
- Set alerts to be informed when costs exceed thresholds

#### Cloud Billing Reports
- Track and understand what you've spent
- Provide ways to optimize costs
- Exportable to BigQuery and then visualizable in Looker Studio

#### Committed Use Discounts (CUDs)
- Consider purchasing a Google Cloud commitment for predictable workloads to access discounted prices
