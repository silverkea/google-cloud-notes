Cloud Source Repositories is a fully featured, private Git repository hosted on Google Cloud. It allows you to store, manage, and track changes to your code.

Here are the key features:

- **Git-Based:** It works with standard Git tools and commands, so you can use your existing workflow.
    
- **Private & Secure:** Repositories are private by default and integrated with Google Cloud's IAM (Identity and Access Management) for fine-grained access control.
    
- **Integration:** It integrates seamlessly with other Google Cloud services like Cloud Build (for CI/CD), App Engine, and Cloud Logging.
    
- **Mirroring:** You can automatically mirror repositories from GitHub or Bitbucket, allowing you to use Cloud Source Repositories for viewing, searching, and analysis while keeping your primary codebase elsewhere.
    
- **Code Search:** Provides powerful semantic code search capabilities across all your repositories.
