## Cloud Change Patterns

### Move applications first then change them
- Lift and shift program for selected applications
- Minimal changes to ways of working
- Once applications are running in cloud, they are ready to be updated more easily

### Change applications before they move
- Re-architect applications first to make them more cloud ready
- Then move them to the cloud

### Invent in greenfield
- Build new innovative applications as cloud first
- Organization may not be ready to move existing applications at this point

### Invent in brownfield
- Invent a new application in cloud environment that will replace and existing legacy application
- Legacy application will only be retired after new application is built and deployed.

### Move applications without changes
- Leverage cloud just to modernize the infrastructure layer, applications remain the same
- Example: using cloud storage and decommission on premises data centers.
- Example: use cloud infrastructure to create virtualized environment for disaster recovery.
