## Security Principles

### Privileged Access
Grants specific users access to a broader set of resources than ordinary users.

### Least Privilege
Advocates granting users only the access they need to perform their jobs responsibilities.

### Zero Trust Architecture
Assumes that no user or device can be trusted by default and must be authenticated and authorized before accessing resources.

## Security Operations (SecOps)
Processes and technologies that reduce risk of data breaches, outages and other security incidents

### Vulnerability Management
Identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities in infrastructure and applications

### Log Management
Collect and analyze security logs from entire environment

### Incident Response
Maintain knowledge and tools to detect and handle any security incident swiftly and efficiently

### Security Awareness Training
Raise awareness and empower staff to protect themselves and organization from incidents.

### Benefits
- Reduced risk of data breaches
- Increased uptime
- Improved compliance
- Enhanced productivity

## Protecting Against Cyber Threats

### Security By Default
Emphasizes integrating security measures into systems and applications from the initial stages of development.

### Security Posture
Refers to overall security status of a cloud environment. Indicates how well an organization is prepared to defend against cyber attacks by evaluating security controls, policies and practices.

### Cyber Resilience
Organization's ability to withstand and recover quickly from cyber attacks. Involves identifying, assessing and mitigating risks and responding to incidents quickly.

## Security Measures
Essential security measures to protect cloud resources from unauthorized access.

### Firewall
Regulates traffic based on predefined security rules.

### Encryption
Converting data into an unreadable format using an encryption algorithm.

### Decryption
Uses encryption key to restore encrypted data back to its original form.

## Cloud Security Concepts

### Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability - CIA Triad

#### Confidentiality 
- Keeping important data safe and secret
- Requires encryption and safeguarding encryption keys
#### Integrity 
- Keeping data accurate and trustworthy
- Includes controls like checksums or digital signatures to verify authenticity and reliability of data
#### Availability 
- Ensuring cloud systems and services are always accessible and ready for use by the right people / systems when needed.
- Cloud environments must be designed with redundancy, failover mechanisms, and disaster recovery plans 

### Control
Measures and processes implemented to manage and mitigate security risks

#### Cloud Control Measures
- Robust authentication measures
- Access restrictions
- Security awareness training

### Compliance
Adhering to industry regulations, legal requirements and organization policies.

Demonstrates commitment to data privacy and security, building trust and minimizing legal and financial risks.

Cloud providers offer compliance frameworks and certifications that organizations can leverage to meet their regulatory obligations.


## Cloud vs On-Premises Security

### Location
- Cloud involves hosting and managing data and applications off-site in data centers operated by cloud provider
- On-premises involves hosting and managing data and applications locally with direct control and responsibility for securing physical environment

### Responsibility
- Cloud provider responsible for securing infrastructure, network, physical facilities. Customer responsible for securing  data, applications, user access and configurations. Applies the [[Shared Responsibility Model]].
- On-premises the organization is responsible for all aspects including infrastructure, network, operating system, applications, data, user access, configurations.

### Scalability
- Cloud offers scalability and elasticity
- On-premises is more costly to scale up and down

### Capital Expenditure
- Cloud follows an operational expenditure (OpEx) model - resources consumed on a subscription basis.
- On premises involves significant capital expenditure (CapEx) to purchase and maintain infrastructure.


## Cybersecurity Threats

### Social Engineering
- Phishing attacks which mimic authenticity to deceive targets.

### Physical Attacks
- Damage to hardware, power disruptions, natural disasters, fires, etc.

### Malware, Viruses, Ransomware
- Malicious software aimed at inflicting damage, disrupting operations, gaining unauthorized access.

### Vulnerable Third Party System
- Without adequate security measures and evaluations, third party systems can become potential threats leaving data security compromised.

### Misconfiguration
- Inadvertently exposing sensitive data and systems to unauthorized access.
