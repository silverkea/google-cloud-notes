## Data Sovereignty and Data Residency

### Data Sovereignty
Data is subject to the laws and regulations of the country where it resides

### Data Residency
Physical location where data is stored or processed

### Google's Support for Data Residency and Sovereignty

- Each region consists of one or more data centers giving control where data resides
- Organization Policy constraints coupled with [[Identity and Access Management (IAM)|IAM]] configuration to prevent accidental storage in the wrong region
- VPC Service Controls allow restricting access to data based on defined perimeters
- [[Google Cloud Armour]] can restrict traffic locations for external load balancer for extra protection
